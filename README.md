# Automated-Listing

#Ecommerce is a gift for everyone on the internet to do business more easily and quickly. However, when ones want to turn a hobby into a little bit more serious, most eCommerce platforms tend to lack certain functions to support and maintain that efficiency.

#This program originated from an idea to make the computer complete the repeat operation task on the e-commerce fashion platform, Grailed, for the human user. For example, in this case, list a batch of products for sale.

#This is only the part for basic operations without any machine learning or computer vision used. Implemented by Python and major packages like Selenium and OS to perform web scrape and web automation.

#With this program the time cost of the operation for one product is reduced from 6mins to 1min.
